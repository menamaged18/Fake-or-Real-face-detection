# Fake-or-Real-face-detection
using 10,000 image half of them are real faces and other half are fake, I have used transfer learning on vgg16, resnet-50, densenet121, mobilenet and inception models on the dataset and compare models results. I have also optimized the learning rate hyperparameter for Adam optimizer using TPE algorithm, and then fine tune last two layer and compare models results,  also I have added extra convolution layer for each model and compare models results.
